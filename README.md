# MIS-373-Labs
This repository includes the weekly labs I completed in my MIS 373 class. 
The instructions for these labs are not included as I do not have the permissions to upload them outside of class.
Please note that these labs have not been updated since I turned them in, so they are likely to be filled with errors and inefficiencies. 
The following are the labs along with a description of the instructions and the score I received on them.

1. java_mjv893.zip (12/12): The zip file contains my files for my Java Classes Lab. It contains 6 parts: Shopping Cart, Temperature Converter, Bank Account,  Certificate Deposit, Grade Calculator, and Lottery Winner.

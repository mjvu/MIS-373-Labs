# MIS-373-Labs
This repository includes the weekly labs I completed in my MIS 373 class. 
The instructions for these labs are not included as I do not have the permissions to upload them outside of class.
Please note that these labs have not been updated since I turned them in, so they are likely to be filled with errors and inefficiencies. 
The following are the labs along with a description of the instructions and the score I received on them.
